# UnMermec

The Mermec VideoInspection application produces a folder with VID files.
In case of a corrupted application, the Mermec Review application cannot read the folder.
This project recovers latitude, longitude, distance and JPEG data from the VID files.
This allows the user to export the separate images into a different project.
